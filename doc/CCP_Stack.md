# Stack PRFs by Common Conversion points (CCP) method

This note will introduce how to stack PRFs by CCP method in two steps.
1. Convert PRFs from time axis to depth axis according to 1D velocity model.
2. Search and stack amplitudes in each bin with calculated pierce points falling in.

## Preparation
Befor the CCP stacking, we should prepare:
### 1. PRFs data with sac format

- the SACHeader of `b`, `delta` and `npts` are required. please make sure that they are correct. The `b` denote the shift time before P arrival.
- All of SAC files belong to a same station must be put into a same **directory with name of the station name**.
- A list file with 10 columns is required in this directory, whose format as:
    - `evt`: the datetime part of sacfile name of each PRF. 
    - `phase`: The phase part of sacfile name of each PRF.
    - `evlat`: The latitude of the event.
    - `evlon`: The longitude of the event.
    - `evdep`: The focal depth of the event.
    - `dis`: The epicentral distance between event and station.
    - `bazi`: The back-azimuth from event to station.
    - `rayp`: The ray parameter of the event.
    - `mag`: The magnitude of the event.
    - `f0`: The gauss factor used in computing the PRF.

### 2. Station list
A text table of station information with 3 columns:
- `station`: The station name which should be same as the directory name including PRF Files.
- `stlat`: The latitude of the station.
- `stlon`: The longitude of the station.

### 3. A parameter file
The parameter file include parameters used in CCP stacking. the format should follow `configparser` as the following example:
```
[FileIO]
# Path to stations with RF sac files
rfpath = /path/to/RFresult

# Path to station list
stalist = /path/to/sta_all.lst

# Path to the lib of Ps ray parameters. 
# If it's empty the ray parameters of Ps would be assumed as that of P arrival
rayp_lib =

# Output data struct after time to depth
depthdat =  /Users/xumj/Researches/NETibet/ccp_result/RFdepth_3D.mat

# Output data struct after CCP stacking
stackfile = /Users/xumj/Researches/NETibet/Ordos_Process/stack_L5

# Station list used to stack
stack_sta_list = /Users/xumj/Researches/NETibet/Ordos_Process/sta_L5.lst

# Path to 1D velocity model
# If it's empty, useing IASP91 model
velmod =

[bin]
# The shape of bins
shape = rect

# period of S wave (to assuming the radius of fresnel zone)
domperiod = 5

# Width of the profile in km
width = 100

# Radius of bins in km
# If it's empty, radius would be assumed following fresnel zone
bin_radius =

# sliding interval of bins in km 
slid_val = 5

[line]
Coordinate of two end points for the profile
profile_lat1 = 40.82
profile_lon1 = 103.451
profile_lat2 = 36.33
profile_lon2 = 108.817

[depth]
# Max depth you wanna convert to
dep_end = 800

# depth interval in converting time to depth
dep_val = 1

[stack]
# Stack RFs from <stack_start> km to <stack_end> km with interval of <stack_val> km
stack_start = 0
stack_end = 150
stack_val = 1
```

### 4. (Optional) A lib of Ps ray parameters.
If you would stack PRFs in a great depth (e.g., D410 or D660), the ray parameters of P arrival cannot represent that of Ps phase. Therefore, 
a library file of Ps ray parameters in different depths and epicentral distance is required in calculating Ps-P time difference.
This lib file has specific binary format. You can generate it by command of `gen_rayp_lib`:
```
usage: gen_rayp_lib [-h] -d DIS_STR -e DEP_STR [-l LAY_STR] [-o OUT_PATH]

Gen a ray parameter lib for Pds phases

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -d DIS_STR   Distance range as 'min_dis/max_dis/interval'
  -e DEP_STR   Event depth range as 'min_dep/max_dep/interval'
  -l LAY_STR   layers range as 'min_layer/man_layer'
  -o OUT_PATH  Out path to Pds ray parameter lib
```

### 5. (Optional) A 3D velocity model
To correct influence by velocity anomalies above the interface you wanna study, 3D velocity model would be used to correct Ps-P time difference.
The model file should be `.npz` format (generated by [`numpy.savez`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html?highlight=savez)) with 5 fields:
- `dep`: Depth axis. 1D `numpy.array` with shape of `(len_dep,)`
- `lat`: Latitude axis. 1D `numpy.array` with shape of `(len_lat,)`
- `lon`: Longitude axis. 1D `numpy.array` with shape of `(len_lon,)`
- `vp`: P wave velocity. 3D `numpy.array` with shape of `(len_dep, len_lat, len_lon)`
- `vs`: S wave velocity. 3D `numpy.array` with shape of `(len_dep, len_lat, len_lon)`

## Convert time to depth
`rf2depth` command would convert PRFs from time axis to depth axis using above preparations:
```
usage: rf2depth [-h] [-d VEL3DPATH] cfg_file

Convert Ps RF to depth axis

positional arguments:
  cfg_file      Path to configure file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -d VEL3DPATH  Path to 3d vel model in npz file
```

The output struct would be saved as a `.mat` file, which can be read in **MATLAB**. Therefore, you can browse items and fields of this file using
**MATLAB** or `scipy.io.loadmat`. The number of items is equal to the number of stations in *Station list*. Each item has 9 fields:
- `Station`: The station name.
- `stalat`: The Latitude of the station.
- `stalon`: The Longitude of the station.
- `bazi`: The back-azimuth of each event (1D array with shape of `(ev_num,)`)
